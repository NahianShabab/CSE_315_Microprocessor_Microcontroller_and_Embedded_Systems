##Problem Description

### Given an Integer N, print the number of faulty numbers between
### 1 to N.

### A number is called faulty if the sum of the divisors of that number ### (excluding 1 and the number itself) is greater than that number.

### For example, 12 is faulty because 2+3+4+6=15>12
### But 6 is not faulty because 2+3=5<6
